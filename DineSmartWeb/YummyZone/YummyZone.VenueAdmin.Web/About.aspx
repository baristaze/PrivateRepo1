                        We’ve made giving restaurant feedback easy and fun! 
                        <br/><br/>

                        Dine Smart 365 enables diners to give targeted, detailed feedback and 
                        get great deals in return. 
                        <br/>It is simple:
                        <span class="emhasize">Leave feedback, win coupons!</span>
                        <br/><br/>

                        Diners can leave ratings and comments about their dining experience in seconds
                        just by tapping on their <span class="emhasize">mobile</span> phones. They can even 
                        interact with the menu items in a restaurant and rate each plate separately! 
                        Next, we deliver ratings and comments directly to the restaurant managers without 
                        disclosing users’ personal information. After that, restaurant managers will have 
                        the opportunity to respond to user feedback with a message, which is delivered directly 
                        to the user’s phone. Restaurant managers can attach a coupon in their messages or they 
                        can opt to send a special offer at a later time. 
                        <br/><br/>

                        There are many other features for our users to enjoy, like: top-picks, favorites, 
                        history, etc. We will be adding <span class="emhasize">social</span> features in the 
                        next version as well.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Dine Smart 365 creates a communication channel between restaurant managers and diners.
                        It is a tool for restaurant managers to manage 
                        <span class="emhasize">customer satisfaction</span> and
                        <span class="emhasize">customer loyalty</span>. It also enables restaurants to launch 
                        sales campaigns.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Dine Smart 365 replaces the traditional, old-fashioned <span class="emhasize">survey</span> 
                        tools for restaurants with a new model. It connects restaurants and diners in a way that 
                        is direct, timely and incentivized for both the diner and the restaurant. Now, restaurant 
                        managers can create customized questionnaires to more closely measure customer satisfaction. 
                        Diners can fill these questionnaires out conveniently through their smart phones, and are 
                        motivated to do so because of the promise of rewards.
                        <br/><br/>

                        As of now, we have enabled select <span class="emhasize">Seattle restaurants only</span>.
